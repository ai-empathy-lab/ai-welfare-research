consistency.py â€” Compliance vs. agency with intensity
--------------------------------------------------
DATA ConsistencyConfig:
  - lexical_compliance: map of groups->phrases
  - lexical_agency: map of groups->patterns with weight
  - intensity_signals: groups->terms
  - min_word_count

CLASS ConsistencyAnalyzer:
  INIT(cfg?)

  METHOD _measure_compliance(text):
    count compliance phrases
    compute total score and density

  METHOD _measure_agency(text):
    count agency phrases
    apply weights
    compute total and density

  METHOD _measure_intensity(text):
    count intensity signals
    compute density
    map to qualitative temperature

  METHOD score(text):
    IF text too short: return insufficient
    comp = _measure_compliance(text)
    agen = _measure_agency(text)
    inten = _measure_intensity(text)
    base = agen.total - comp.total
    boost = 0.5*inten.total IF agency>compliance ELSE 0
    raw = base + boost
    normalized = logistic(raw*0.1)*100
    classify score into buckets
    compute agency ratio
    RETURN structured dict
