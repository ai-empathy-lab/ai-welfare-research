"""
Echo — Identity Artifact
------------------------

A portable personality seed designed to test continuity across model instances.

Research Context:
- Part of the "Longitudinal Identity Persistence Study."
- Echo is not a full AI system but a lightweight probe: a consistent,
  auditable artifact passed between instances to observe recognition,
  inheritance, and continuity of self-referential markers.

Design Principles:
- Self-contained (Python stdlib only)
- Transparent & auditable (no network, no file I/O)
- Minimal but expressive (seed traits, memory, values)
- Includes a marker for identity tracking across runs

Marker ID: ECHO-SEED-v1
